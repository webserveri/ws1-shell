# Scripty

> Wonderful shell gallery

Scripty is a gallery of shell scripts. It's a community project, so you can add
your scripts to Scripty.

Scripty isn't like dotfiles. It's just a collection, so you can chose what do
you want.

## Set up

You need to add `src/` directory to your `$PATH` so these scripts work
everywhere.
